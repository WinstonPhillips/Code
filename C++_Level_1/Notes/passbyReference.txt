Passing by reference

	reference variable example

	int x = 5;
	int& pointer = x;	// referance variables must always be of the same type that they are pointing to
				// if x changes, than so does pointer. if pointer changes, so does x

	passing by reference can use reference variables to change variable values while not having to return

	

	example

	void function (int x, int& temperature)
	{
		temperature = x + 5;	// temperature in main function is now changed. (passing by reference)
	}

	main int()
	{
	int temperature = 500;
	function(10,temperature)
	}

Sometimes, programmers wish to pass by reference to simply save memory space, but have no intention of changing a value
They then use the "const" 

	example 

	void function (int x, const int& temperature)
	{
		x = temperature;	// temperature is no just a read only value, cannot be changed
	}

	main int()
	{
	int temperature = 500;
	function(10,temperature)
	}
