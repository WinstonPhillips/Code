Arrays

comparing lottery 

set 3rd array = lottery array

we then compare guesses to lottery copy 

code for comparing two arrays :

for (int i = 0; i < NUM_CHOICES; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < NUM_CHOICES; j++)
			{
				if 
					{	
						guesses[i] == lottCopy[j];
						correct++;
						lottCopy[j] = 0;	// now no other numbers can be compared because 0 is not included in random ints
						break;			// after first right comparison, breaks the loop so right numbers are not counted twice as being right
					}
			}
	}
