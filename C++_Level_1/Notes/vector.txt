Vectors 

	vectors are a class of data (like string)
		
	much like an array

	vectors can be resized, unlike arrays
	
	#include<vector> 	// need the library

	declaring a vector
	

myOtherVector.push_back(30); 	adding the number 30 to the vector myOtherVector
					so now has 20 6's and 1 30

myOtherVector.pop_back();	takes last element in vector and gets rid of it 

cout << myOtherVector.at(i) << " ";	self explanatory

 myOtherVector.clear();    you now have a zero element array 

myOtherVector.resize(15,3); 	you now have an array with 15 elements, all composed of threes
