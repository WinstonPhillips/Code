pointers 

	for functions: ex

void myFunction (int x)
{
 static int y = 5;
 x = x+y;
y++
return x;
}
		// look at resizearray.cpp on website


example of passing poointers
void passybyValue(int x)
{
cout << x;
}

void passbyRef (int& x)  // pass by ref is like pointers for dummies
{
cout << x
}

void printbyPtr(int *x)
{
cout << *x;
*x = *x +1;		// much like passing by reference. changes the information at the mem address
}

	***** both passing by ref and passing pointers allow us to access the original data

	// fun fact: return 0; stops main wherever it is put


library: <memory>

introducing: smart pointers  // they automatically "clean up" for you
