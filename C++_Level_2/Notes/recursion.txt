Chapter 5- Recursion

algorithm- a sequence of steps for solving a problem

recursive algorithm- solves a problem by breaking down problem into smaller sub problems

	must describe how to actually DO SOMETHING 
		known as the base case



recursive function- a function that calls itself

depth of recursion- how many times a function called itself 

base case: if a problem can be solved now, without recursion, then the function solves and returns 

recursive step: recursive steps used to solve problems
