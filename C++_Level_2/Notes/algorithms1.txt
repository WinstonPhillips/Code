Searching algorthms

algorithm- a sequence of steps for accomplishing a task

		a search algorithm is a method of locating a specific item in a larger collection of data


linear search algorithm- uses a loop to sequentially step through each piece of data (one at a time)
	pretty straightforward
	
	advantage: simple, easy to understand 
			array doesn't have to be in order
	disadvantage: SLLOOOOWWWWW

binary search algorithm
	instead of testing data starting from the beginning, we start from the middle

	if middle element > desired element, we look at second half of list

	if middle element < desired element , we look at the first half of the array

	keep doing this until we get to our number
