Queues

has a libraray: #include <queue>

declaring: queue<string> myQueue;

in Arrays:

will have a head and a tail node

first in, first out data type

acts much like an array
	
the head and rear, however,  are indexes of the array that hold the first and last items

so, each time you add something, tail = tail +1
	initially start it off with tail = -1 in constructor
	
in linked lists:

	too easy
	just use common sense

myQueue.front() --- returns the front of the queue(first node entered)

myQueue.pop() --- removes/pulls first item of the list(first node entered)

myQueue.back(): accesses the node at the back of the queue (last node entered)
