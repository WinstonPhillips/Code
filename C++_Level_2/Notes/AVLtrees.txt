heaps 

a heap can be be more efficient than a bst because it automatically balances the tree

Treaps
	combination of binary search tree and a heap

AVL Trees!!

AVl: A binary search tree 

	balance = height of the left subtree - height of right subtree
	balance must be -1, 0, or 1

how do we fix an unbalanced tree?

Rotation! - how we fix this problem

	left left rotation
	right right rotation
