Heaps

each node is greater than it's children
	the top node is the largest value
	Literally just like a binary tree, just kind of ordered (not necessarily a binary search tree)

Minimum heap (lowest value at the top)

	a binary tree where each node's value is smaller than their child

	INSERT
		you always insert in the tree's next empty spot
			looking tio to bottom, and then left to right
		2) we flip the parent with the child (if child is less than parent)
			you keep doin this until the min-heap property is kept

	REMOVE
		a heap is an implementation of a primary queue. The root is top priority
		A heap is a first in, first out basis (always remove the root)

		1) get rid of smallest value
		2) make the last level's last node the root
		3) Fix the violation by swapping the node with it's child until there is no longer a violation
		
		**A HEAP IS TYPICALLY IMPLEMENTED AS AN ARRAY

		equation for finding parent/children: leftchild: parent = index(2) + 1
						      rightchild: parent = index(2) + 2
						      parent finding children: (Index - 1) / 2
