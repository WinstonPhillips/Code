class templates

template<typename BooYah>
class Node
{
/////////////////////
}
	// you can use BooYah in all of your class functions
object creation:: Node<double> myNode;
			// now, everywhere that there is booyah there is now a double.

for class templates, must type #include file.cpp before #endif
	file.cpp is the file that goes with that .h file

in the function declarations (in the cpp file), before each and every function you must put templay<typename BooYah>
	

compiling:: cannot compile as usual

	    You only have to compile main... if the cpp was included in a .h file we cannot compile it
