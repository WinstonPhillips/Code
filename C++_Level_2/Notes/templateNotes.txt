Templates

template<typename LLama>
	look at power point

LLama getHighest(LLama highest, Llama lowest)
{
	// you are now working with llama
}

functions are either returning float, int, double or whatever BASED ON WHAT YOU SENT IT

that is the beauty of templates-- very versatile

useful when you have similiar functions returning different data types
